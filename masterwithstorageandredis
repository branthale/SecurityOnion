Convert master w/ local storage to use storage node(s):

In regard to converting an existing master with local storage to allow connection of a storage node, please try the following (snapshot first, if possible):

On the master please do the following (in your desired directory):

sudo touch so-master-add-storage
sudo chmod +x so-master-add-storage

Copy the following text into the file and run it using "sudo ./so-master-add-storage"

#!/bin/bash
# Script to convert master with local storage to support addition of one or mode storage nodes.
#
# Check for root
if [[ $(/usr/bin/id -u) -ne 0 ]]; then
        echo "This script needs to be run as root.  Please try again using sudo."
        exit

echo "sudo tail -f /var/log/logstash/logstash.log"

After running the script, the master should now be configured to output to Redis, as well as to pull from Redis locally.  You should then be able to configure a separate node as a storage node as you normally would.

Please test this using your test master instance and let me know the results.


Hot-Warm

Additionally, I've been working with Mike to document and test a complete hot-warm setup.

We are still working to finalize this configuration and will send over the details when we are finished, so that you can test.
 
Replication

If you are only using the two referenced 2TB and 100TB nodes, we'd recommend using a hot-warm setup vs. a replicative setup.

Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you would like me to clarify anything.
